## Description
Ship'd is a way for UVA students to save money on shipping. If you are making an online purchase, but haven’t spent enough to qualify for free shipping, you can post on Ship’d.

In addition to helping you save, Ship’d connects you with other UVA students with similar interests which can lead to new friendships and a better and kinder future.
